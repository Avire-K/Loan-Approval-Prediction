# **Dataset Overview:**  
The dataset used for this project contains 11 independent features, which include various factors such as annual income, cibil score, and more. These features are utilized to predict the dependent variableâ€”whether the loan will be approved or not.  
  
# **Model Architecture**  
The deep learning model follows a straightforward architecture:  
  Input Layer: Processes the 11 input features.  
  Hidden Layers: Two fully connected hidden layers that learn complex patterns from the data.  
  Output Layer: Contains two nodes:  
    One node predicts the probability of the loan not being approved.  
    The other node predicts the probability of the loan being approved.  
    The node with the higher probability is used for the final prediction.  
      
# **Performance**  
Despite its simplicity, the model achieves an impressive 95.5% accuracy, making it a reliable tool for loan approval predictions.
